 * This swatch allows us to access three buttons on one analog pin 
 * of the ATtiny 45/85.  When you usually read a button on a 
 * digital pin, closing the button will send 5 volts to the pin 
 * telling the micro controller it is closed. On or off. On an 
 * analog pin, we can read a range of values between 0 and 1023 
 * or 0 volts and 5 volts. By connecting different values of 
 * resistors to buttons on an analog pin, we can tell the ATtiny 
 * to read a button press as a range of values instead of on or 
 * off. This means we can connect many buttons to just one pin 
 * and use conditional statements to determine  if a button was 
 * pressed. Or a ribbon was pulled in this case.
 * 
 * I used a 1k, 3k, and 5k resistor for the three buttons, 
 * with one lead to power and the other the button. 
 * 
 * Use the softwareSerial_ATtiny sketch and fritzing diagram in the 
 * documentation link to read your values once you have 
 * constructed your fabric PCB and switches.
